# ExpandableListViewWithCheckBox
An expandable list view with checkboxes

This Android Studio code creates an ExpandableListView of CheckBoxes, saves the selected data in an ArrayList and displays the checked items as a Toast.

# Recommendation
You can use an interface to store and pass the arraylist of checked items and the same boxes will remain checked even after collapsing or expanding the listview.
